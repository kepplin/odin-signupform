## About

This is a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form). The aim of this project was to utilise the frontend side of forms. The form doesn't do anything other than look cool.

## Instructions

- Enter details in the form. If your info does not align with the form validation, the form inputs border will be red. If it does align with the form validation, its border will be green.

- The account button and log in link do nothing.

- The links on the bottom of the image link to the image.

## How it Works

1. The only Javascript is the confirm passowrd validation. Which checks if the values of the 'password' input and 'confirmPassword' input are the same. If they aren't a message is entered into a span, reading 'PASSWORDS DO NOT MATCH.'
